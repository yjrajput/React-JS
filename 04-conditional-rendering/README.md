## ðŸ“– About React.js Conditional Rendering  

In React, **conditional rendering** means displaying different UI elements depending on certain conditions.  
It works just like JavaScript conditions (`if`, `else`, `switch`, ternary operators), but instead of controlling program logic, it controls **what gets displayed in the UI**.  

Conditional rendering makes React applications **dynamic and interactive**, allowing components to change based on state, props, or user actions.
